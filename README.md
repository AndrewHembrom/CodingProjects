# CodingProjects
This repository is for the easy to medium difficult Coding projects that I will be making on my Journey of Learning how to code. 
The Projects I'm making aren't a part of a big course or anything. 
It's just ideas and small projects that I come across on the internet and seem cool to me.

### Main Takeway from this repository is to better enhance my understanding of the code and the algorithms used.
